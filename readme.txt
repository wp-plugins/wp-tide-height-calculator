WP-Tide-Height-Calculator is a plugin that gives an indication of the height of the tide at certain times in the tidal phase. 
== Description ==

The Rule of Twelfths is a rule of thumb for estimating the height of the tide at any time, given only the time and height of high and low water. This is important when navigating a boat or a ship in shallow water and when launching and retrieving boats on slipways on a tidal shore.

The rule assumes that the rate of flow of a tide increases smoothly to a maximum halfway between high and low tide before smoothly decreasing to zero again and that the interval between low and high tides is approximately six hours. The rule states that in the first hour after low tide the water level will rise by one twelfth of the range, in the second hour two twelfths, and so on according to the sequence – 1:2:3:3:2:1.
